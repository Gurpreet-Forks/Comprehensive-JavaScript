# Comprehensive JavaScript
If you are looking for a programming language to develop flexible and efficient applications, JavaScript is an obvious choice. Whilst offering great benefits, the complexity of the entire JavaScript ecosystem can be overwhelming.

The JavaScript Workshop is your one-stop solution to mastering this language. This book begins with a broad introduction to the fundamental programming concepts of the language, it's history, and its relationship to other web technologies like HTML and CSS. This introduction is followed up with a direct, focused approach to the core workings of the JavaScript language including how to deal with scope, event-loop, error catching, and more. You'll learn advanced approaches and explore server-side JavaScript, the ingest and processing of external datasets, and modern frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue. Then, you’ll move on to advanced topics that include the ability to write unit tests and effectively perform test-driven development tasks. You’ll understand which paradigms are involved in prototypes, inheritance, and objects and perform asynchronous tasks in JavaScript with callbacks, generators, and promises.
By the end of the book, you’ll walk away feeling capable of tackling any real-world JavaScript development problem.



## What you will learn
* Write simple programs using the fundamentals of JavaScript
* Create a stateful to-do model which returns mutable data
* Update CSS styles within the page, including styles for specific interaction states
* Build an application which will upload a file to a directory on the server side
* Study and implement best practices to write clean code.
* Work with package managers, such as Gulp, Grunt, and Webpack
* Run a model using tensorflow.js
* Write test cases for a simple addition function
